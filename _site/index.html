<h2 id="whats-cardverse">What’s CardVerse?</h2>
<p>CardVerse is a machine capable of authenticating, grading, and sorting Magic: The Gathering cards with a throughput of 2 cards per minute with a total capacity of 1000 cards.</p>

<p>I, along with my team, developed this project as my ECE Senior Design Project.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p>We won a total of $7000 prize money at UMass’s ‘22-‘23 Berthiaume Innovation Challenge</p>

<h2 id="goals-and-motivation">Goals and Motivation</h2>

<p>Collectible card games (CCG) or Trading card games (TCG) are types of card games that combine strategic deck-building elements with features of trading cards. One of the earliest and most significant in terms of market and volume is a CCG named <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong>.</p>

<p>Despite the enormous market, the industry faces several challenges:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sophisticated Counterfeit Cards:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Unnoticeable to the naked eye</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Artificial Alterations on Defects:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Ink tweaks to mask artifacts</li>
      <li>Rebacked Cards (Splicing 2 Cards together)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Poor Card Conditions (Artifacts):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Bends</li>
      <li>Dents</li>
      <li>Scratches</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Given these issues, it becomes crucial to have a card graded and authenticated by a human expert before buying or selling.However, the current pipeline faces challenges with a scarcity of human experts and a large number of customers. This results in an extremely time-consuming and expensive process.</p>

<p>This is where <strong>CardVerse</strong> comes into play.</p>

<p>The project has 4 primary objectives:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Artifact &amp; Defects Detection:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We trained a <strong><em>machine learning model (YOLOv5)</em></strong> on our custom dataset, which consisted of 500 cards evaluated by human experts.</li>
      <li>The model achieved a <strong><em>97% accuracy</em></strong> in detecting defects when tested on a separate set of cards.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Authenticity Detection:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>To determine the authenticity of a given card, we examined two aspects:
        <ol>
          <li><strong><em>Weight Test</em></strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Since an original MTG card typically weighs between 1.7 and 1.8 grams, the system employs a weighing scale to identify counterfeit cards early in the pipeline.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong><em>Rosette Pattern / Green Dot Test</em></strong>
            <ul>
              <li>We designed an image processing pipeline (contouring / pattern matching) to conduct tests on the 40X zoom images of the card’s <a href="https://www.mtginformation.com/counterfeits#:~:text=%E2%80%8B-,The%20Rosette%20Test,printings%20of%20the%20same%20set.">rosette pattern</a> and the so-called <a href="https://www.detecting-the-fakes.com/checking-details/green-dot-check/">green dot</a>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Grading Schema:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We developed a precise grading algorithm that objectively evaluates the condition and quality of the cards. The algorithm considers data points inferred from factors such as the <strong><em>type</em></strong>, <strong><em>number</em></strong>, and <strong><em>intensity</em></strong> of the defects mentioned above.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sorting Mechanism:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The custom-built gantry system sorts the cards based on the output directed by the grading system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
